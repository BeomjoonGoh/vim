## Plugins

### [vim-autocomplpop](https://github.com/othree/vim-autocomplpop)

> Auto trigger complete popup menu.

It uses `L9` library.  Global variable `g:acp_enableAtStartup` is on.
Function `ToggleACP()` toggles `autocomplpop` plugin, and it is mapped to
`F5`. For `C`(`C++`) files, complete option is set differently.


### [vim-snipmate](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate)

> `SnipMate` aims to provide support for textual snippets, similar to
> `TextMate` or other Vim plugins like `UltiSnips`.

It depends on `vim-addon-mw-utils`, `tlib_vim`.

Snippets are stored in `snippets` directory and triggered with `<Tab>` key.
`g:snipMate.no_default_aliases` is set so that aliases such as `C++` -> `C` is
disabled.


### [vim-latex](https://github.com/vim-latex/vim-latex)

let g:Tex_DefaultTargetFormat='pdf'
let g:Tex_ViewRule_pdf = 'open -a Preview'
let g:Tex_FoldedEnvironments=''
let g:tex_indent_brace=0
```

Note the following default mappings:
* `<Leader>lv` view pdf.
* `<Leader>ll` compile latex.


### [goyo.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim)

> Distraction-free writing in Vim.

Mapped to `<Leader>f`. Uses user defined `goyo_enter()` to have `number`, and
`colorcolumn`.


### [vim-indent-object](https://github.com/michaeljsmith/vim-indent-object)

> Vim plugin that defines a new text object representing lines of code at the
> same indent level. Useful for python/vim scripts, etc.

### [vim-taglist](https://github.com/BeomjoonGoh/vim-taglist)

> This is a mirror of [taglist.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273).

>
> The "Tag List" plugin is a source code browser plugin for Vim and provides
> an overview of the structure of source code files and allows you to
> efficiently browse through source code files for different programming
> languages.

Mapped to `<F3>` to toggle the taglist. For `C`, `C++` and `Python` codes,
taglist is updated upon writing.  Settings used are:

```vim
let Tlist_Exit_OnlyWindow=1
let Tlist_WinWidth=30
let Tlist_Use_Right_Window=1

`Cpp`, `Fortran`, `Netrw`, `Python`, `QuickFix`, and `TeX`.


### [vim-txt](https://github.com/BeomjoonGoh/vim-txt)

> This is modified version of 'Vim universal .txt syntax file' by Tomasz
> KalkosiÅ„ski.
